**OpenNapkin** is a graphical [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) client written in 
[Gambas3](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html). I wrote OpenNapkin as I wasn't able to find other
Gopher client that wasn't written for console only or that wasn't part of a much bigger web-browsing suite.
**OpenNapkin** offers just what you can see on the screeshot: a way to load Gopher sites, basic interaction
(double clicking on a line lets you interact with that line) and basic bookmark keeping. Nothing more,
nothing less.
